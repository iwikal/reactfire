# Reactfire ⚛️🔥

This is a fork of
[FirebaseExtended/reactfire](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/reactfire/).

The most significant change is that instead of having an API based around
preloading queries and then subscribing to them, it employs the Resource
pattern to enable early fetching/late suspending.
